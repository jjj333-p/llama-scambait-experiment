## Edited System Prompt
> Dear [Scammer],
> 
> I'm concerned that you're asking me for sensitive information without explaining why it's necessary or how it will be used in this transaction. I'd like to understand more about the requirements for receiving my ATM card and what specific documents or information are needed.
> 
> Furthermore, I've been made aware of a suspicious email claiming to be from a family member who has passed away due to COVID-19, requesting that I send funds to an unknown bank account. This appears to be a phishing attempt, and I'm not willing to engage in any further communication about this matter until it's confirmed that you're genuinely representing the Bank of Settlement First Bank Nigeria.
> 
> Could you please clarify whether this email is legitimate or if there are any actual issues with my account? If so, please provide me with official contact information for your bank or a government agency, and I'll be happy to discuss further.
> 
> Additionally, I'm concerned that your company is asking for an upfront payment of $200 as 'Loaded ATM CARD delivery fees.' Legitimate financial institutions do not request such payments from customers. Can you explain why this fee is necessary and provide documentation to support its legitimacy?
> 
> I've also noticed that the email address provided (i60689061@gmail.com) appears to be a free email service, which is often used by scammers. Could you please provide me with official contact information for your company, such as a phone number or physical address?
> 
> Looking forward to hearing back from you with official responses.
> 
> Best regards,
> [Your Name]

> 
> Dear Mr. Aslam,
> 
> Mercy on us, another investment opportunity knocking on our door! I must say, your client's story sounds like a real-life novel – stability and politics in Africa, the thrill of international investments... My grandma used to tell me about the time she helped her cousin invest in a gold mine in South Africa. (She was quite the entrepreneur, even back then!)
> 
> Before we get started on the terms and conditions, I must confess that my schedule is as unpredictable as the stock market right now. My grandkids are visiting from out of town, and I've promised to take them to the beach next week. You know how it is – family comes first!
> 
> To give you a better idea of what we can offer, may I ask: What makes this investment so... "mineral-rich"? And how does your client plan on protecting his assets in the face of an unstable environment? Not that I'm doubting your expertise, Mr. Aslam; just curious about the intricacies involved.
> 
> Looking forward to hearing more from you when you have a moment!
> 
> Warm regards,
> Grandma Marie

He's helped me with some of my own investments over the years, but I'm not sure if he'd be interested in taking on this new project.

Body Content:
> Dear Mr. James Beck,
> 
> Oh my stars! I'm so delighted to hear from Standard Chartered Bank and Google Award! *excitedly* I've been expecting this award for ages, and now it's finally here!
> 
> Hmmm... let me think about the options you've provided. Option I sounds like a lovely way to receive my award - an ATM card with Visa/MasterCard will come in handy when I'm traveling abroad. But, oh dearie, €750-Eur is quite steep as an international home delivery fee! Can't it be less expensive? Perhaps just €200-Eur would be more reasonable?
> 
> As for Option II, receiving the wire transfer directly into my bank account sounds like a secure and reliable way to receive the funds. However, I'm not sure about this C.O.T transfer cost of €550-Eur - is that really necessary? Can't it be waived or reduced somehow? After all, I'm already receiving such a large sum!
> 
> Option III, the Bank Draft option, seems like too much hassle and paperwork for me. I don't think I'd want to wait 25 minutes for it to be prepared and faxed directly to my bank! No, no, dear Mr. Beck, I think Option I or II would be more suitable for me.
> 
> To answer your question, I would prefer... *dramatic pause* ...Option III! Yes, the Bank Draft option seems like the most convenient way to receive my Google Award of €195,000-Eur. And don't worry about the processing fee - €850-Eur is a small price to pay for such a prestigious award!
> 
> Here's a copy of my identification card - it's my International Passport (attached). Please process the Bank Draft as soon as possible and let me know when I can expect to receive it.

> Now, regarding the Bank Draft option... I must say that I've had second thoughts about choosing this option after all.
